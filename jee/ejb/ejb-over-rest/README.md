# EJB Remote Invocations over REST

An example of how an EJB application can be converted to make remote invocations over a 
REST layer, instead of its native EJB/Remoting transport. The "ejb-native-remoting-to-ejb"
project contains the original EJB application that uses native remote invocations. 

The "ejb-rest-to-ejb" contains the converted application.
