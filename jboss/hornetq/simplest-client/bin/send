Usage:

    ./bin/send \\
     --jndi 127.0.0.1:4447 \\
     --destination /queue/novaordis \\
     --connection-factory /jms/RemoteConnectionFactory \\
     --messages 1 \\
     [--username jmsuser --password jmsuser123] \\
     [--connections 10] \\
     [--threads 10] \\
     [--sleep-between-sends-ms 1000]


The client sends the specified number of messages (or just one message if --message is omitted).

If --sleep-between-sends-ms is used, the client sleeps the specified number of milliseconds after
sending a message - on each thread. If the option is not used, the client sends the specified
number of messages as fast as it can and exits.

If no --username (and corresponding --password) options are specified, the JMS Connections will be
created anonymously. The server may or may not allow anonymous connections, depending on its
security settings.

Just only one connection is created by default, unless --connections is used.

Just only one thread is used to send messages, by default, unless --threads is used.
